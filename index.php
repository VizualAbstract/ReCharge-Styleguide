<h1>Pattern library</h1>
<h5>Missing something?</h5>
<p>The Pattern Library is in a state of transition. It's becoming steadily complex, but it's not our main focus. It will be abstracted as necessary, with the main goal of maintaining usability. The <strong>Library</strong> contains all brand standards, components and snippets. <strong>Scratch Pad</strong> will contain examples of code found throughout the application.</p>
