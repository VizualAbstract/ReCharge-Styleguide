/*
	Components: Tabs
	Version 1.0
	Date: 9-1-2016
	Author: Corey M. Capetillo
	9-1-16:
		- Create the first page of tabs
		- Add the ability to use the grid system within the tab content. But because of the tab's background color, use display: table so the heights are equal
		- Add a statistics sidebar. Keep it in Tabs section for now
